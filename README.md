# 100-days-76


This repo includes my solution to a section of a Udemy course called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu.

This challenge is about NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays, i.e;

+ How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays.

+ How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.

+ How broadcasting ðŸ“£ works with ndarrays.

+ How to do linear algebra with NumPy.

+ How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.

+ How to manipulate images as ndarrays.

**specifically;**

+ Create arrays manually with np.array()

+ Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()
 
+ Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray
 
+ Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices
 
+ Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication
 
+ Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible
 
+ Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
